## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r initial plots}
data(TRACE)
head(TRACE)


TRACE$death <- as.numeric(TRACE$status != 0)

ggplot(TRACE, aes(x = time, y = factor(death), col = vf)) + geom_jitter()

TRACE %>% group_by(death) %>% summarise(mean_vf = mean(vf))

```

## event

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
gg <- glm(formula = death ~ vf, data = TRACE, family=binomial()) 
summary(gg)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
