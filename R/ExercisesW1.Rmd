## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r initial plots}
data(TRACE)
head(TRACE)


TRACE$death <- as.numeric(TRACE$status != 0)

ggplot(TRACE, aes(x = time, y = factor(death), col = vf)) + geom_jitter()


TRACE %>% group_by(death) %>% summarise(mean_vf = mean(vf))

library(survival)
out <- phreg(Surv(time, status!=0) ~ strata(vf) + chf + wmi, data = TRACE) 
names(out)
dd <- data.frame(vf = c(1,0), 
                 chf = median(TRACE$chf), 
                 wmi = median(TRACE$wmi))

str(out)
class(out)

methods(predict)
getAnywhere(predict.phreg)

predict(object = out, newdata = dd, se = 0)
#objects needed in prediction


#
```

## event
```{r}
ggplot(TRACE, aes(x = time, y = factor(death), aes(col = vf))) + geom_jitter() + facet_grid(. ~ vf)

```


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
gg <- glm(formula = death ~ vf, data = TRACE, family=binomial()) 
summary(gg)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
